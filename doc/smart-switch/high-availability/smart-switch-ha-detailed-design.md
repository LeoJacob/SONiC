## 2. Telemetry

To properly monitor the HA related features, we will need to add telemetry for monitoring it.

The telemetry will cover both state and counters, which can be mapped into `STATE_DB` or `COUNTER_DB`.

* For ENI level states and counters in NPU DB, we will have `VDPU_ID` in the key as well as the `ENI_ID` to make each counter unique, because ENI migration from one DPU to another on the same switch.
* For ENI level states and counters in DPU DB, we donâ€™t need to have `VDPU_ID` in the key, because they are tied to a specific DPU, and we should know which DPU it is during logging.

We will focus on only the HA counters below, which will not include basic counters, such as ENI creation/removal or generic DPU health/critical event counters, even though some of them works closely with HA workflows.

### 2.1. HA state

First of all, we need to store the HA states for us to check:

* Saved in NPU side `STATE_DB`, since `hamgrd` is running on NPU side.
* Partitioned into ENI level key: `ENI_HA_STATES|<VDPU_ID>|<ENI_ID>`.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| local/peer_state | HA state of local / peer ENI. |
| last_local_state_update_time_in_ms | Last update time of local state. |
| local/peer_term | Current term of local / peer ENI. |
| local/peer_term_start_time_in_ms | Start time of current term of local / peer ENI. |
| local/peer_eni_create_time_in_ms | Creation time of local / peer ENI. |
| peer_ip | IP of peer ENI. |
| eni_data_path_vip | DP VIP of current ENI. |
| bulk_sync_start_time_in_ms | Start time of current bulk sync operation. If no bulk sync is ongoing, set to 0. |
| shutdown_by_upstream | Is requested to be shutdown by our upstream service. If true, we will stop auto peering the ENI, in cases like DPU reboot. |

### 2.2. HA operations

Besides the HA states, we also need to log all the operations that is related to HA.

HA operations are mostly lies in 2 places: `hamgrd` for operations coming from northbound interfaces and syncd for SAI APIs we call or SAI notification we handle related to HA.

#### 2.2.1. HA operations

All the HA operation counters will be:

* Saved in NPU side `COUNTER_DB`, since the `hamgrd` is running on NPU side.
* Partitioned with ENI level key: `HA_OP_STATS|<VDPU_ID>|<ENI_ID>`.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **state_enter*(req/success/failure)_count | Number of state transitions we have done (Request/Succeeded Request/Failed request). |
| total_(successful/failed)_*_state_enter_time_in_us | The total time we used to transit to specific state in microseconds. Successful and failed transitions need to be tracked separately, as they will have different patterns. |
| switchover_(req/success/failure)_count | Similar as above, but for switchover operations. |
| total_(successful/failed)_switchover_time_in_us | Similar as above, but for switchover operations. |
| shutdown_standby_(req/success/failure)_count | Similar as above, but for shutdown standby operations. |
| total_(successful/failed)_shutdown_standby_time_in_us | Similar as above, but for shutdown standby operations. |
| shutdown_self_(req/success/failure)_count | Similar as above, but for force shutdown operations. |
| total_(successful/failed)_shutdown_self_time_in_us | Similar as above, but for force shutdown operations. |

#### 2.2.2. HA SAI APIs

All the HA SAI API counters will be:

* Saved in DPU side `COUNTER_DB`, as SAI APIs are called in DPU side syncd.
* Partitioned with ENI level key: `HA_OP_STATS|<ENI_ID>`.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *_(req/success/failure)_count | Number of SAI APIs we call or notifications we handle, with success and failure counters too. |
| total_*_(successful/failed)_time_in_us | Total time we used to do the SAI operations in microseconds. Successful and failed operations should be tracked separately, as they will have different patterns. |

### 2.3. HA control plane communication channel related

#### 2.3.1. HA control plane control channel counters

HA control plane control channel is running on NPU side, mainly used for passing the HA control commands.

The counters of this channel will be:

* Collected by `hamgrd` on NPU side.
* Saved in NPU side `COUNTER_DB`.
* Stored with key: `HA_CP_CTRL_CHANNEL_STATS`.
  * This counter doesnâ€™t need to be partitioned on a single switch, because it is shared for all ENIs.

| --- | --- |
| channel_alive_count | Number of channels that are alive for use. Should be either 0 or 1. |
| channel_connect_count | Number of connect calls for establishing the data channel. |

| channel_connect_failed_count | Number of connect calls that failed because of any reason other than timeout / unreachable. |
| channel_connect_timeout_count | Number of connect calls that failed due to timeout / unreachable. |

#### 2.3.2. HA control plane data channel counters

HA control plane data channel is running on DPU side, mainly used for bulk sync to transfer the flow events to the other side.

The counters for this channel will be:

* Collected on syncd on DPU side.
* Saved in DPU side `COUNTER_DB`.

##### 2.3.2.1. Per DPU counters

Since the channel is per DPU, hence these counters will be partitioned with card level key: `HP_CP_DATA_CHANNEL_STATS`.

| channel_connect_timeout_count | Number of connect calls that failed due to timeout / unreachable. |

##### 2.3.2.2. Per ENI counters

The messages that sent via the data channel should be tracked on ENI level, hence they should be partitioned with ENI level key: `HP_CP_DATA_CHANNEL_ENI_STATS|<ENI_ID>`.

### 2.4. NPU-to-DPU tunnel related (NPU side)

The second part of the HA is the NPU-to-DPU tunnel. This includes the probe status and traffic information on the tunnel.

#### 2.4.1. NPU-to-DPU probe status

Latest probe status is critical for checking how each card and ENI performs, and where the packets should be forwarded to.

In our design we have 2 different types of NPU-to-DPU probes: Card level and ENI level. They should:

* Saved in NPU side `STATE_DB`.
* Partitioned with key:
  * Card level: `HA_NPU_TO_DPU_PROBE_STATUS|<VDPU_ID>`
  * ENI level: `HA_NPU_TO_ENI_PROBE_STATUS|<VDPU_ID>|<ENI_ID>`

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| probe_status | Final probe status after counting the probe status pinning. It can be UP or DOWN. |
| last_probe_update_timestamp | Last probe update time. It can be wall-clock timestamp, so we can easily check for debugging purpose. |
| pinned_probe_status | The pinned probe status.<br/>(This field is for card level probe status only.) |
| probe_packet_in/out | Number of probe packets that we received from and sent out from each DPU.<br/>(This field is for card level probe status only.) |

#### 2.4.2. NPU-to-DPU traffic control state

Depending on the probe status and HA state, we will update the next hop for each ENI to forward the traffic. This also needs to be tracked.

All counters should be:

* Saved in NPU side `STATE_DB`.
* Partitioned with ENI level key: `HA_NPU_TO_ENI_TUNNEL_STATUS|<ENI_ID>`.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| next_hop_dpu_ip | The IP of destination DPU. |
| pinned_next_hop_dpu_ip | The pinned next hop DPU IP. |

#### 2.4.3. NPU-to-DPU tunnel counters

On NPU side, we should also have ENI level tunnel traffic counters:

* Collected on the NPU side via SAI.
* Saved in the NPU side `COUNTER_DB`.
* Partitioned into ENI level with key: `HA_NPU_TO_ENI_TUNNEL_STATS|<ENI_ID>`.

> (TBD: These counters should have a more SAI-friendly name)

### 2.5. NPU-to-DPU tunnel related (DPU side)

On DPU side, every NPU-to-DPU tunnel traffic needs to be tracked on ENI level as well:

### 2.6. DPU-to-DPU data plane channel related

The next part is the DPU-to-DPU data plane channel, which is used for inline flow replications.

* Collected on the DPU side via SAI.
* Saved in DPU side `COUNTER_DB`.

(TBD: These counters should have a more SAI-friendly name)

### 2.7. DPU ENI pipeline related

The last part is how the DPU ENI pipeline works in terms of HA, which includes flow operations:

* Collected on the DPU side via SAI.
* Saved in DPU side `COUNTER_DB`.
* Partitioned into ENI level with key: `HA_DPU_PIPELINE_STATS|<ENI_ID>`.

| Name | Description |

Please note that we will also have counters for how many flows are created/updated/deleted (succeeded or failed), aged out or resimulated, but this is not in the scope of HA, hence omitted here.

## 3. SAI APIs

Please refer to HA session API and flow API HLD in DASH repo for SAI API designs.
